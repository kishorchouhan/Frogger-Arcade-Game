Project Overview
You will be provided visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

Why this Project?
Games have a lot of objects, and those objects do a lot of different things; but sometimes those objects do some very similar things as well. This creates a great opportunity to practice object-oriented programming, an important programming paradigm that influences your application architecture and provides performance optimizations.

What will I Learn?
You will learn JavaScript’s object oriented programming features to write eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects. You will discover a variety of ways that inheritance and delegation can be used to create well-architected and performant applications.

How Does this Help My Career?
JavaScript enables the development of complex applications on the web.
JavaScript runs on normal web browsers, which makes it one of the most accessible and flexible programming languages.
Complex applications must be “broken down” into simpler entities that manage their own properties and functionality
Here is an example of what the Frogger-like game should look like:

Note:

The player character should not be able to move off the board.
The game should reset when the player character hits a bug.
The game should reset when the player character reaches the water.
And here are some more detailed instructions to help you get started.
